# The Assembly Mindset

1. Assembly is not a high-level language, therefore, the usual mental models of learning a programming language are not going to help us.
2. Almost anything in a high-level programming language is an abstraction. This not just applies to the big ideas, but to the smaller ones as well.
3. To sustain this journey, curiosity and the urge to find things out is paramount.
   - Because we don't know what is required to be known, before we can start learning assembly.
   - But that doesn't imply that we can't learn assembly.
4. Context and Interpretation, these two things rule assembly.
   - As long as you remember these things, you will save yourself a lot frustration.
   - Most of the time, the reason behind my frustration and agitation was simply that I wasn't complying with the rules.
   - And what are the rules? ***Context and Interpretation***.
   - We need not to dive into these right now, because it is not the right time and place. These will be introduced when we will go hands-on.
5. Assembly is bare-metal. It knows no bounds.
   - At one moment, you program might run perfectly.
   - But the next, it might run into an issue.
   - Finding problems in asm programs is a headache because they are too subtle.
   - What seems obvious is not obvious here.
   - And that goes back to point number 1, its abstraction less.
   - You never know when your program goes into "undefined behavior" territory.
   - Just swapping two lines two times to make them come to their initital place could change the outcome of the program. And that's very much true. It happens to me a lot of times.
   - Just writing a character and then backspacing it changes the outcome. What the heck is this!
   - Therefore, complying with conventions of assembly is very important.
6. Progressive learning.
   - As long as you don't hurry and keep learning things progressively, you will live a happy life.
   - But, if you hurried, it is not going to end good. I have learned this the hard way.
7. Keep your composure calm. Keep your attitude calm. If you can't keep calm, either of the two things will happen:
   - either you will leave the course, or
   - you'll become more calm, more silent and more peaceful. Assembly will ground you.
   - I am way too silent now, in comparison to when I started. I have worked on myself for over 8 months, to make myself more calm and mindful. It did worked. But the amount of silence I have achieved in one-month of learning assembly is just hard to digest.
9. Last, don't stress! Enjoy your life, and assembly.
