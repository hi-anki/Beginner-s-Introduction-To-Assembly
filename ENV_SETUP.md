# Enviornment Setup

Great progress. If you have reached environment setup, then you are familiar with the general theoratical introduction of computer architecture and assembly. And now it is the time to practice things.

To practice assembly, we would require certain tools on the table. But don't get too caught up in choosing the tools. The ones's being mentioned here are sufficient.

| Tool              | Purpose                                           | Tool Choice               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Linux Distro      | The OS where which will allow us to do everything | read below                |
| Code Editor (IDE) | To write assembly code                            | VSCode                    |
| Assembler         | To assemble the code                              | GAS (GNU Assembler, `as`) |
| Linker            | To link the code and make it executable           | GNU Linker (`ld`)         |

All these tools are open source.

- To install VSCode, [visit here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- To install `as` and `ld`, install `binutils` by doing `sudo apt install binutils`.
  - These softwares are just two in the collection of binary tools, offered by GNU.

- Now comes the OS.
  - I use kali linux. But you don't have to.
  - You can use Ubuntu, or any debian based distribution, or basically any linux OS.
  - If you are using linux, of any kind, you will find your way to make it work.
  - If it doesn't work and you can't figure out why, just spin a kali vm or a lightweight debian distro in virtual box. That's it.
  - Don't worry!

That's all you need when you are starting. As we will move forward, we will introduce more tools, with proper reasons.

For now, you are well equipped.
