# Introduction

Hi, Ankur here! Welcome to x86 assembly.

### Note: The Work Is In Progress

# Straightforward FAQ

Which flavour of assembly?
  - x86_64 assembly

Which syntax?
  - Intel

Which platform?
  - 64-bit GNU Linux

Which assembler?
  - GNU `as`

Code editor (IDE)?
  - I prefer VSCode, but it doesn't matter which IDE you use.

What are the prerequisites?
  - Basic mathematics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
  - Understanding of basic programming concepts (variables, data types, size, control flow, iteration, functions, arrays and strings) in at least in python or C. If any other language, no problem.
  - Curiosity to find things out.
  - Ability to think and reason.
  - Understand my english.
  - Rest, we will figure out together.

Why to choose this repository to learn over others?
  - The only advantage this repository has is that it assumes you have the least prerequisitie knowledge.
  - It doesn't want you to know boolean algebra, or algebra in general.
  - It doesn't want you to known high-school math.
  - It is as detailed, as it is possible.
    - At times, you will find yourself just repeating one single thing two-three times, until it becomes your second nature.
  - It has got a curriculum, not the best one, but the one I thought I had, because I started with the same prerequisites. Stricitly, I only had basic programming knowledge + other surface level tech knowledge, which everyone posses these days.
  - It has got no links to external page, becuase this spirals me. I have everything that is required you to learn consolidated in one single page. No links to other pages.
  - I have designed it to be the one-resource I need to learn all the assembly that is required to hop on RE/BE pathway.

Why not to choose this repository to learn over others?
  - Way too detailed. This is explicitly designed to cater my needs, which are, extreme detailing, to the point that I have no more questions.
  - Not very much formally aligned to the concepts. This is my nature that I build on analogies.
    - I don't want to sound definition-correct and know nothing.
    - I am good when I am not very much definition-correct, but understand things to the root level.
  - It's not perfect.
    - The word choice might not perfect.
    - My english is not perfect.
    - Even my understanding might not be perfect, from your lens.

# How I Have Learned Assembly?

Primarily, I use ChatGPT (by OpenAI) to learn the concepts in depth.

But humans using AI are put under various criticism, which is not wrong, it is necessary for me to prove that my understanding is not a slop. Partly these notes would indicate that, but I have no issues to be open about my learning process with ChatGPT.
  - I ask for a topic to learn, it tells me about a bunch of topics.
  - Then we decide upon which one is right to learn right now, which builds on what I understand so far.
  - Then I ask for a beginners inroduction to it, because asm can go really deep.
  - Then I ask for a code piece, with no explanation of it.
  - And now the actual work starts.
  - I sit alone and brainstorm how it is doing what it is doing.
  - Later I write my understanding and send it to ChatGPT. It then corrects me wherever I am wrong and applauds me wherever I am right.
  - Sometimes, I have to go down a rbbit hole myself and it can't help much. And I do it.
  - I am not completely dependent on it, I just utilise what it is good at, having a large dataset of knowledge. And I utilise what I am good at, the curiosity to dissect everything.

I don't prefer YouTube videos much.
  - First, there are very less.
  - Second, curriculum.
    - I don't like the order in which assembly is taught.
    - Also, these videos assume that I know certain things already, which, I don't know.
    - And that's why, I don't prefer wasting my resources.
  - Third, I like to navigate on the basis of my curiosity. Partly, my curisoty is my curriculum.
    - And that is reflected in the course.
    - Often, almost all the times, I never learn what I decide to learn. Because there is so much that I need to know before I can learn that thing.
    - And learning those things spiral me into the curiosity loop, which I am learning to handle.
    - But you need not to worry. Your time is not going to be wasted in any spiraling.

In the end,
  - I claim, I am not perfect.
  - I claim, this project is not perfect.
  - I claim, my understanding is not perfect.
  - This project itself is not aimed for perfect people.
  - It aims at imperfects like me.
