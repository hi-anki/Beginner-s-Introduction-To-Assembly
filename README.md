# Lets Learn Assembly 

Hey, Ankur here!

This is the place where I keep the notes I take while learning assembly.

I am learning computer architecture and assembly so that I can hop on reverse engineering and binary exploitation pathway.

I am learning x86_64 assembly on GNU Linux. I am writing in intel syntax and assembling it with GNU Assembler. I know, a weird combination. Ideally, `nasm` must have been used, but it's ok.

Their is no intention of creating a course right now. Because I am still figuring out how to learn assembly. The high-level approach we all have clearly doesn't work here. And that's why I am learning in extreme-depth so that I can figure this out.

Later, once this is completed, I can think about transforming it into a course. But not now.

I do have a couple of ideas to create a complete assembly ecosystem which is kind of lacking right now. It is definitey not mainstream and that's why not everyone seems to be learning it.

But yeah, that's for future. Right now, I am completely focused and understanding assembly.

Primarily I use ChatGPT (by OpenAI) to learn assembly.

My process is simple.
  - I ask for a topic, it tells me about a bunch of topics.
  - Then we decide upon which one is right to learn right now.
  - Then I ask for a beginners inroduction to it, because asm can go really deep.
  - Then I ask for a code piece and now the actual work starts.
  - I sit alone and brainstorm how it is doing what it is doing.
  - Later I tell it my understanding and it shows me where I am right and where I am wrong.
  - Sometimes, I have to go down a rbbit hole myself and it can't help much. And I do it.
  - I am not completely dependent on it, I just utilise what it is good at, having a large dataset of knowledge. And I utilise what I am good at, the curiosity to dissect everything.

I do use YouTube videos and some text-based sources, but I don't rely on them much, because there is too much noise and I don't have time and energy to waste.

That's it. 

Stay tuned for updates on this project.

Until then, thank you! Bye......
