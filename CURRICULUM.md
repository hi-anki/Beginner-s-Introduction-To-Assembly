| Sr. No | What You're Supposed To Do? | The Reasoning? |
| ------ | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1. | [Locking the ***assembly mindset***](./1-general-introduction/the-asm-mindset.md) | Assembly is not just another programming language, its different. | 
|    | | Time and energy is sacred. I have wasted a lot of them. To save all that frustration, it is necessary to lock in the right mindset required to understand architecture and assembly. | 
|    | | Doing this as the first thing will save you a lot of frustration, that is bound to come later. |
| 2. | [A General Introduction To The Technicalities](./1-general-introduction/2-technical-introduction.md) | It will introduce you to the most important and widely used concepts. | 
|    | | It will help you to start thinking in low-level terms. Plus, a tint of practicality, before we can actually go practical. | 
|    | | Knowing them right now will lay down a strong foundation of yours basics. |
| 3. | [A Theoretical Introduction To Assembly](./1-general-introduction/3-theoretical-intro-to-asm.md) | A lot of problems in understanding why assembly is like this only, stems from not knowing how assembly has evolved. |
|    | | This theoretical introduction lays down a foundation which we will use to save a lot of time in future. |
| 4. | [Environment Setup](./ENV_SETUP.md) | Before we start writing assembly, it is important to setup the environment. |
| 5. | [A Practical Introduction To x86 Assembly Through *Hello World*](./2-practical-introduction/readme.md) | Introducing terminologies before introducing the code is not straightforward here. |
|    | | A combination of both is required for us to understand the terms and the structure of the code properly. |
|    | | And therefore, a practical introduction is the best way to do it. |

# The Reasoning Behind This Curriculum

The problem with modern day tutorials is that they feel like a flood of information. *Learn this, Learn that, Then that......* 

It feels hollow. I don't know what I am doing. And that's the biggest problem for me.

To learn efficiently, make sense of what I am doing, and understand things deeply, it is important for me to understand why I am doing what I am doing.

In my learning journey, half of the time, I was just figuring out:
  1. What I am actually supposed to do?
  2. Why I am supposed to do it?
  3. How I am supposed to do it?
  4. And why only that way? Why not the other way!

When I knew what I am doing, why I am doing it, how I should be doing it and why only that way, learning and understanding becomes so damn easy.

This is the most important thing about this curriculum.
  - If you are investing your time and energy on a course, it is your right to know the WH-family of your supposed actions.
  - This curriculum is designed to inculcate this philosophy.
