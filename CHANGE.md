I have started learning assembly and computer architecture so that I can start reverse engineering. So far, I was moving with the mindset of learning progressively, ask every question and make a clean note of all of them.

This approach is very good but recently I had a perspective shift, for good reasons.

Watching this [keynote by Andreas Kling at FUTO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YM7pDMLvr4&pp=ygUEZnV0bw%3D%3D), when he introduced the ladybird slide, the last thing mentioned there was "Just the browser, no side quests." This thing kinda stuck with me and forced me to rethink how I am doing what I am doing.

I am definitely learning assembly, there is no question in that. But my subtle actions seems to be aligning with creating a text-based assembly course. Even that's how I named the repository. And this creates a subtle conflict between who I think I am working to be come v/s who I am actually becoming with my actions. Basically, my current actions are not fully aligned with the purpose I have started with.

And honestly I am responsible for this is because I never wrote my purpose on stone. When there is no strict guiding light, it is so easy to deflect. Though I don't deflect easily these days, but this subtle action was like the plane deflecting by 1 degree. It might not feel at first, but the change can be noticed once you reach the destination.

The action I am talking about is crafting the notes with so elegance. That is definitely a good thing, but it takes extra time and energy to do that. Their is nothing wrong with sumamrising my understanding, but there has to be a more efficient process to do that.

And therefore, I am updating the readme to reflect that. And I hope that one problem that recently surfaced will also be solved by this action.
